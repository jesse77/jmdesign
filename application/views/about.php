                    <p>
                        Let's talk about my favorite subject ME!
                        Ok, so that's not entirely true. I Have a beautiful family, A wife of over 11 years, and 5 sons, all names of which begin with the letter 'J' hence the JMDesign, that way if this ever becomes prosperous they won't have to change the name! Brilliant right? Anyway, I am sure you said '5 boys, that's crazy' and I would say 'yes...' We kept going for the girl but boys kept coming out, I think I have purged my body of x-chromosomes... Outside of being a Husband and a Father, I have many passions, only one of which is photography. 
                    </p>
                    <p>I am a public speaker, largely speaking to young people about their potential, not solely focusing on their strengths, but I believe, to be truly strong we cannot be afraid to grow the very things we are weak at, not just avoid, or hide those weaknesses. I try to invite people into my home (with all the chaos of children) to get to know the real me. I want people to say 'What you see, is really him'. </p>

                                    A HUGE passion I have is of course photography. I love the process of taking a photo, editing, posting, really each part is so important to me, and equally as exciting. I think I offer something unique, I want to make this a more personal experience. I love technical, but it's not everyone's language. I want to bring you photos and MORE. I want to wow your friends, your customers, your competitors, YOU! I am not in this for fame, but I am in this to shift the way we look at the world through a lens, and I want EVERYONE to join in and help make that happen. Hire me, and well you don't just get a photographer, but you get my passion, and that is why I just try and be myself, even when I am behind the camera!
                                </p>

                                    Website design/development was something I worked on years ago. It wasn't until recently that I picked it back up, and I am really enjoying it! It makes sense for me to continue beyond just taking photos. Why not make this a seamless process where one group can accomplish it all? After trying to make a go of the website business 10 years ago, I LOATHED waiting for images and content. Now I just get what I need! It actually really helps me create because I get to know the inner workings of a business/brand and can build something that I feel I now know something about, rather than just 'shooting from the hip' I get to see the inside first, and then put a face on it! 
                                </p>

                                    I got into the professional video department in 2006, and since then have shot/edited/directed/lit/created over 250 hours of Television here in Alberta, Canada. I have been involved with some short films, and worked on a few I have made myself. Film is growing into something exciting, especially for business. It's easy to talk to like someone who is open with their life, and if companies were to adopt this as well, it would make us feel that we 'know' it better, trust it, and want to choose it more often. A great way to show this is to incorperate some video into your website. Employee testimonies, inner workings, future goals/plans, anything that can draw your audience inside and let them feel some ownership is what I am always after when shooting video.
