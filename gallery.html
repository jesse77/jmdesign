It's not because anything is run any better, kind of, it's not really cause fruit and veg are more expensive...

I know some neon has made a small comeback but not to the extent of how I deeply loved them, especially neon orange. I remember saying 'Neon colours will NEVER go out of style!!'' I am glad they did... Along with hammer pants.... and Windows 98...

Its like the bags barf all over the house and it takes a week to wipe up the mess... I guess my incredible super power of procrastination doesn't play well with that either...

I liked Sesame Street as a kid, I loved Bert and Ernie, especially Ernie, he was a real ham... ok not a 'real' ham but I think its a saying. Wow its like I am thinking like a woman right now, spaghetti brain, you never know how one end gets to the other, yet somehow out of the seeming randomness they can find it... Problem is I cant find the end.

So soon enough we will be hosting dinner parties and hobnobbing with all sorts of  affluent pop-icons and billionaire philanthropists. People will speak of our parties across the city, they will know of me by name only, all wishing to catch a glimpse of the man behind the scene... I think I want to be the Great Gatsby... Minus the whole getting killed part.

You might think I would say cats, but really the only cat that touches my moat will be in a burlap sack...

They don't listen, they seem to not care about anyone but themselves, they make you sneeze, they poop in a little box that is disgusting, its like they are a 16 year old girl that has daddy issues and wears too much cheap perfume... Not only that but for some reason everyone seems to like them... I think this parallel I have discovered is too freaky, I have to stop now...

It would be great to go there one day...  This is Kelowna BC and I've been here lots of times. This time, as I wandered around like a creeper in the dark, I cut my foot on a pine cone.

It would be great to go there one day...  This is Kelowna BC and I've been here lots of times. This time, as I wandered around like a creeper in the dark, I cut my foot on a pine cone. So I threw that pine cone in the lake, and showed that pine cone what's what. Moral of the story? No I'm asking, I can't seem to find one for myself..."/>
